# Adithya Athreya

Computer Science undergraduate focused on building practical software systems and strengthening core fundamentals in data structures, algorithms, and backend development.

## What I work on
- Java-based applications (Swing, JSP, Servlets)
- Backend development with MySQL and SQL-based systems
- Full-stack web projects with clear separation of concerns
- Problem solving using DSA (Python / Java)
- CLI tools and system-oriented projects

## Technical Skills
- Languages: _Java | Python | C | C++ | TypeScript | JavaScript_
- Backend: Spring Boot | FastAPI | Flask | Netty(RPC) | Socket.IO | 
           **Distributed systems(Raft consensus)** | REST APIs | **Streaming systems (Redpanda, Apache Flink)**
- Databases: MongoDB Atlas | DynamoDB | Supabase | IndexedDB
- Frontend: React | Next.js | TypeScript | Cytoscape.js | Framer Motion | 
            Real-time dashboards | PWA architecture
- Tools: AWS(Lambda, Step Functions) | Pandas | XGBoost | OpenAI API | Git
- Concepts: **Distributed systems** | **Consensus algorithms** | **LSM-Tree storage engines** | 
            Event-driven architecture | ETL pipelines | 
            **End-to-end encryption(RSA, AES-GCM, Diffie-Hellman, SHA-256)** | 
            Graph algorithms(Dijkstra, PageRank) | BFS | DFS | Backtracking

## Current Focus
- Deepening DSA for technical interviews
- Building end-to-end projects with clean architecture
- Writing maintainable, readable code
- Preparing for software engineering internships

## Projects
Most repositories here are:
- Academic + self-driven projects
- Built from scratch to understand internals
- Documented with problem statements and implementation details
